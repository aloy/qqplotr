\title{Q-Q and P-P plot extensions for 'ggplot2'}
\description{
This package extends some \code{ggplot2} functionalities by permitting the
drawing of both quantile-quantile (Q-Q) and probability-probability (P-P)
points, lines, and confidence bands. The functions of this package also allow
the detrend adjustment, proposed by Thode (2002), which helps reduce visual
bias when assessing those plots.
}
\details{
The functions of this package, presented as \code{ggplot2} Stats, are divided
into two groups: Q-Q and P-P related.

Each of the groups is composed of three Stats: \code{point}, \code{line}, and
\code{band}. Those Stats, while independent, complement each other when
plotted together.
